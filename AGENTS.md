## ZURAFFA MISFIRE RULE (HARD, NON-NEGOTIABLE — HARDCODED TOP RULE)

**On ANY misfire (test failure, compilation error, runtime crash, unexpected output) related to zuraffa:**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on the first misfire.
2. **Report the issue** to zuraffa GitHub (`arrrrny/zuraffa`) with: the command that failed, expected vs actual output, and root cause.
3. **Continue with a workaround** to make the task pass (e.g., skip the failing test, use an alternative approach, or mock the failing component).
4. **Add a comment** in the code explaining the workaround applied and linking to the zuraffa GitHub issue.

**On ANY misfire related to the repo itself (not zuraffa):**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on the first misfire.
2. **Report the issue** to the repo's GitHub with full details.
3. **Continue with a workaround** to make the task pass.
4. **Add a comment** in the code explaining the workaround applied.

This rule takes precedence over all other rules. Never skip a misfire or rationalize it away.

## The forklift pool owns the PR — never merge a pull request yourself

Every pull request in these repos is reviewed by the **forklift pool**
(`arrrrny/forklift` — the local PR-review pipeline). It mints three tasks, in
this order, and that chain is the only sanctioned way from "PR opened" to "PR
merged":

1. `PR review <repo>#<n>` — the automated review; it posts its actionable
   findings on the PR.
2. `Apply review fixes <repo>#<n>` — one fixes round, pushed onto the PR's
   branch.
3. `Merge PR <repo>#<n>` — the merge itself; the task refuses while reviewer
   findings are still unaddressed.

**Never merge or close a PR by hand, and never merge one because it "looks
finished".** A hand merge lands the code while findings are still open: the
pool's fixes task is then killed by its closed-PR guard — the dispatcher log
says `…#<n> is closed — cancelled, no agent started` — and every finding the
review posted is dropped with nobody to own it. That is not a review, it is a
race the pipeline cannot win.

**Wait for the pool, and read the pool for the state.** The three task rows are
the truth; the PR page is not:

```bash
# the pool's board — loopback, IPv4-only (never `localhost`)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/tasks \
  | jq -r '.[] | select(.title | test("PR review|Apply review fixes|Merge PR")) \
          | [.title, .status, .id] | @tsv'
```

One row per stage. `status` is one of `queued`, `running`, `done`, `failed`,
`needsInput`, `cancelled`, `paused`. The PR is done when the
`Merge PR <repo>#<n>` row reads `done`. A fixes row that reads `failed` or
`cancelled` means the PR was **not** reviewed-and-fixed: read the row's
`errorMessage`, fix the cause, and let the pipeline requeue it (relabelling a
failed task requeues it in the same call — `POST /tasks/<id>/label`).

**An agent can simply wait for the whole process** — poll the board above until
the `Merge PR` row is terminal. Everything else is the pool's job: it drives
the review, the fixes round and the merge.

<!-- tmp-clone:begin -->
## Work in a `/tmp` clone — never in `~/Developer`

Every piece of work on a PR or an issue happens in its own clone under `/tmp`,
and that clone dies with the task:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git /tmp/<repo>-<pr-or-issue>
```

Never clone into `~/Developer`, and never clone into the forklift checkout —
a bare repo slug as the clone target is how a stray checkout ends up inside the
repo root, and a clone left behind in `~/Developer` is indistinguishable from
the primary checkout. The pool's lanes already mint their clones this way
(`/tmp/fix-pr-<n>`, `/tmp/review-pr-<n>`, `/tmp/issue-<n>`, …) and remove them
when the task settles.

This repository wraps Google ML Kit frameworks for Swift Package Manager compatibility. It converts CocoaPods-distributed ML Kit frameworks to XCFrameworks.

## Role

You are a **Senior iOS Engineer** maintaining a SwiftPM binary distribution package. Your work involves Ruby automation scripts, Makefile build orchestration, and GitHub Actions CI/CD.

## Core instructions

- Target iOS 15.0 or later (matches Package.swift platform requirement).
- Swift tools version 5.9 (matches Package.swift).
- Do not introduce third-party frameworks without asking first.
- This is NOT a typical app project. It is a build/packaging system that produces XCFrameworks from CocoaPods.

## Project structure

- `Package.swift` - Swift package definition with 17 library products and 30+ binary targets
- `Podfile` - CocoaPods dependencies for downloading ML Kit frameworks
- `Makefile` - Build orchestration (bootstrap, build, create-xcframework, archive)
- `scripts/` - Ruby and shell automation scripts
- `Resources/` - Info.plist templates for frameworks that lack them
- `xcframework-maker/` - Submodule for XCFramework conversion tool
- `Example/` - Reference iOS app demonstrating ML Kit modules
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD for version checking and building

## Key workflows

1. **Version check**: `check-mlkit-updates.yml` runs daily, creates GitHub issues for new ML Kit versions
2. **Build**: `build-mlkit.yml` is triggered manually, builds XCFrameworks and creates releases
3. **Local build**: `./scripts/build_all.sh <version>` for local development

## Script conventions

- Ruby scripts use standard library only (no gems beyond CocoaPods)
- Shell scripts are POSIX-compatible where possible
- All scripts should handle errors gracefully and provide clear output

## PR instructions

- Test automation scripts locally before committing
- Verify Package.swift syntax: `swift package dump-package`
- Update documentation if adding new modules or changing build process

## Test concurrency (fleet guard)

Cap test concurrency at **2** — one un-capped `flutter test` fan starved the
shared host's services once (load 260; arrrrny/forklift#176).

There is **no config-file knob for `flutter test`**: it ignores
`dart_test.yaml` entirely (its only test-config file is
`flutter_test_config.dart`, an execution hook), so the flag is the only
lever — and it must be passed every time:

```sh
flutter test --concurrency=2
dart test -j 2
```

A repo whose `dart_test.yaml` carries `concurrency: 2` already defaults to it
for `dart test`; pass the flag anyway when you override it, and never raise
the number on a host that also runs the forklift pool. CI carries the same
flags in `.github/workflows`.
